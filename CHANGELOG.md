## Ralph Loop Integration Details

### What is Ralph Loop?

Ralph Loop is a Claude Code plugin (`ralph-wiggum`) that enables autonomous, iterative development. When you execute a task with Ralph Loop:

1. Claude reads the task and PRD context
2. Works on the implementation iteratively
3. Reviews its own output each iteration
4. Continues until completion criteria are met
5. Stops after max iterations or when task is complete

### How to Use Ralph Loop

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install Claude Code (not VS Code)
   - Install the ralph-wiggum plugin: `/plugin install ralph-wiggum`

2. **Execute a Task**:
   - Click the ▶ button on any task card
   - Select "Execute with Ralph Loop"
   - Click "Execute with Ralph"

3. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Terminal panel shows real-time output
   - Task card shows "Running" state with animated indicator
   - Completion notification when done

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "kaiban.ralph.command": "/ralph-loop:ralph-loop",
  "kaiban.ralph.maxIterations": 5,
  "kaiban.ralph.completionPromise": "",
  "kaiban.claude.useRalphLoop": false
}
```

### Command Format

The extension constructs the Ralph Loop command as:

```
/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "Task: [task-label]

[task-description]

PRD Context:
[prd-content]" --max-iterations 5
```

This ensures Claude has full context about the task and its requirements.
