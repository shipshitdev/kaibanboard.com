## .agent/TASKS|PRDS Architecture

This extension works with the **classic .agent/TASKS|PRDS architecture** that AI agents and development workflows use:

### Directory Structure

```
your-project/
├── .agent/
│   ├── TASKS/           # Task files (.md)
│   │   ├── feature-1.md
│   │   └── bug-fix-1.md
│   └── PRDS/            # PRD files (.md)
│       ├── feature-1-prd.md
│       └── bug-fix-1-prd.md
└── src/
    └── ...
```

### Why This Architecture?

- **AI Agent Compatible**: Most AI agents expect this structure
- **Universal Standard**: Works across different tools
- **Separation of Concerns**: Tasks and PRDs are clearly separated
- **Scalable**: Easy to organize large numbers of tasks

### Task File Format

Each task in `.agent/TASKS/` should have:

```markdown
## Task: Your Task Title

**ID:** unique-task-id
**Label:** Your Task Title
**Type:** Feature|Bug|Enhancement
**Status:** Backlog|To Do|Testing|Done
**Priority:** High|Medium|Low
**PRD:** [Link](../PRDS/your-prd-file.md)
```
