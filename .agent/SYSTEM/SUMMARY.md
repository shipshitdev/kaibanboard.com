## Team Notes

**Important:**
- Extension requires **Cursor IDE** (not compatible with VS Code)
- Extension checks `vscode.env.appName` on activation and shows error if not Cursor
- All API keys stored securely in VS Code SecretStorage

**Known Issues:**
- Coverage thresholds temporarily lowered to allow git push
- 4 tests skipped due to UI changes (reject button removed)
- PRD path resolution can be complex with relative paths

**Testing:**
- Run tests: `bun test`
- Watch mode: `bun test:watch`
- Coverage: `bun test:coverage`
- UI tests: `bun test:ui`

**Development:**
- Watch mode: `bun run watch` (auto-compiles on changes)
- Launch extension: Press `F5` in Cursor
- Reload extension: `Cmd+R` in Extension Development Host
