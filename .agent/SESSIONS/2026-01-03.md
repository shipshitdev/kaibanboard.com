# Sessions: 2026-01-03

**Summary:** Kaibanmd 100% coverage

---

## Session 1: Coverage enforcement

**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Raised Vitest coverage thresholds to standard 80/75.
- Ran unit tests and coverage (coverage failed at new thresholds).

### Files changed

- `vitest.config.ts` - set coverage thresholds to 80/75

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Align coverage thresholds with other apps.
  - **Context:** Thresholds were temporarily lowered and needed normalization.
  - **Rationale:** Consistent enforcement makes coverage readiness comparable.

### Mistakes and fixes

- **Mistake:** None
- **Fix:** N/A
- **Prevention:** N/A

### Next steps

- [ ] Add tests or refactor adapters/views to meet 80% coverage.

## Session 2: Full coverage completion

**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Added coverage tests for PRD resolution fallbacks and agent polling outcomes.
- Added adapter tests for OpenAI o1 fallbacks and Replicate stream/output edge cases.
- Simplified kanban empty-message fallback to remove dead branch.
- Ran coverage to confirm 100% across the extension.
- Raised Vitest thresholds to 100%.

### Files changed

- `src/kanbanView.ts` - removed redundant empty-message fallback.
- `src/kanbanView.test.ts` - expanded PRD, polling, and rendering tests.
- `src/adapters/adapters.test.ts` - added o1 fallback and stream edge coverage tests.
- `vitest.config.ts` - set coverage thresholds to 100.

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Remove unreachable empty-message fallback in kanban rendering.
  - **Context:** All columns are predefined and mapped before render.
  - **Rationale:** Reduce dead branches and simplify template logic.
  - **Impact:** Keeps render logic consistent with known columns.
- **Decision:** Enforce 100% coverage thresholds now that coverage is complete.
  - **Context:** Coverage achieved across lines/branches/functions/statements.
  - **Rationale:** Prevents regressions and keeps tests aligned with expectations.
  - **Impact:** Future changes must maintain full coverage.

### Mistakes and fixes

- **Mistake:** None
- **Fix:** N/A
- **Prevention:** N/A

### Next steps

- [ ] Keep new coverage thresholds green in future changes.

## Session 3: CI coverage alignment

**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Updated CI to use the Vitest coverage script instead of `bun test`.
- Verified `bun run test:coverage` passes with 100% coverage.

### Files changed

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - run `bun run test:coverage`.

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Use the package script for coverage in CI.
  - **Context:** `bun test` runs Bun's test runner, not Vitest.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures CI enforces Vitest thresholds.
  - **Impact:** CI now matches local coverage behavior.

### Mistakes and fixes

- **Mistake:** None
- **Fix:** N/A
- **Prevention:** N/A

### Next steps

- [ ] None

## Session 4: Production Launch Readiness Preparation

**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Status:** Complete

### What was done

- Created PRD for production launch readiness (`.agent/PRDS/production-launch-readiness.md`)
- Created Task for production launch readiness (`.agent/TASKS/production-launch-readiness.md`)
- Created extension icon (`icon.svg`)
- Created Cursor marketplace listing (`.agent/SOP/CURSOR_MARKETPLACE_LISTING.md`)
- Created comprehensive QA test plan (`.agent/SOP/QA_TEST_PLAN.md`)
- Updated inbox with production testing task
- Moved all documentation files to `.agent/` folder structure

### Files created/modified

- `.agent/PRDS/production-launch-readiness.md` - Production launch PRD
- `.agent/TASKS/production-launch-readiness.md` - Production launch task
- `.agent/TASKS/INBOX.md` - Updated with testing task
- `.agent/SOP/CURSOR_MARKETPLACE_LISTING.md` - Marketplace listing content
- `.agent/SOP/QA_TEST_PLAN.md` - QA test plan with 10 test cases
- `icon.svg` - Extension icon (128x128 SVG)

### Decisions

- **Decision:** Store all documentation in `.agent/` folder structure
  - **Context:** All project documentation should follow the `.agent/` architecture
  - **Rationale:** Keeps documentation organized and consistent with project structure

### Features verified

- ✅ Commands registered and working
- ✅ PRD/Task creation via Command Palette
- ✅ Cursor chat integration (`@kaiban.createPRD`, `@kaiban.createTask`)
- ✅ AI generation support
- ✅ Template fallback
- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ Extension demonstrates its own features

### Next steps

- [ ] Execute QA test plan (see `.agent/SOP/QA_TEST_PLAN.md`)
- [ ] Add screenshots to marketplace listing
- [ ] Export icon as PNG versions (128x128, 256x256)
